<h1><p style="text-align: center;">Preamble</p></h1>
This project is for educational purpose only, and it is not intended to be used. </br>
Let's Cry of Joy (aka LCJ) was first developed for my annual project at my school. I decided to make it open source because why not.</br>
It is a functioning Ransomware, meaning that if you take the executable in the folder named "executable", it will encrypt the whole computer.</br>
This code work without installing any external packages. This is because I wanted to make it harder to the Reverse
Engineers.
Feel free to fork this project or modify it has you want, but I won't be responsible for any problem that may occur.</br>

<h1>Related Project</h1>
Some codes are related to other projects that I have done. They are available on the following links :

<h1>Changelog</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Added multiple READMEs to the modules</li>
</ul>

<h3>Encryptor</h3>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Decryptor</h3>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>KRAM (Key Recreating Appending Module)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The script is now giving the code random RSA key paris (like before), but also gives random hexadecimal name for each encrptors and decryptors</li>
    <li>The file name start with either a 6 or a 9 : 6 is for the public key (the encryptor), and 9 is for the private key (the decryptor)</li>
    <li>For more information, go to the KRAM module's folder : <a href="https://github.com/lisandro-git/Lets_Cry_of_Joy/tree/main/modules/KRAM">KRAM</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>GOBL (GoLang BuiLder)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This script is intended to create executable for the Ransomware. It iterates through the files created by the KRAM module.</li>
    <li>For more information, go to the GOBL module's folder : <a href="https://github.com/lisandro-git/Lets_Cry_of_Joy/tree/main/modules/GOBL">GOBL</a></li>

</ul>

<h3>EM (Evasion module)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Evasion module has been created so that the Ransomware can evade sandboxes</li>
    <li>You can find a more detailed list on this linked github page : https://github.com/lisandro-git/sandbox_evasion</li>
