<h1>Preamble</h1>
This project is for educational purpose only, and it is not intended to be used. </br>
Let's Cry of Joy (aka LCJ) was first developed for my annual project at my school. I decided to make it open source because why not.</br>
It is a functioning Ransomware, meaning that if you take the executable in the folder named "executable", it will encrypt the whole computer.</br>
This code work without installing any external packages. This is because I wanted to make it harder to the Reverse
Engineers.
Feel free to fork this project or modify it has you want, but I won't be responsible for any problem that may occur.</br>
